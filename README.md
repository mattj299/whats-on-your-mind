## Project idea

Users can share what they're thinking and either remain anonymous or share there name.
Meant to be a friendly zone so people can simply write out what they're thinking.
People can just share there thoughts for example if they need to let something out they can, just type it here.

## Make it work in localhost

In order to make the code work in localhost you need to switch the url variable in client/api/index.js to const url = "http://localhost:5000/posts";
